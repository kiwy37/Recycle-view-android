# Recycle-view-android

This is a basic Android Studio application that displays 50 animals from various continents. When a user clicks on an animal from the list, the application displays the next fragment. This fragment shows the name of the selected animal and its continent with the associated background color. The app utilizes two different layouts, as each continent has its own customized display mode in the RecyclerView.
